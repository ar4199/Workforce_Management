# Workforce_Management

## üè≠ Industrial Workforce Analysis using NLP, Clustering & Streamlit Dashboard

### üìä Overview
This project analyzes the **industrial classification of the workforce in India** using **data cleaning, NLP-based grouping, clustering, and visualization** techniques.  
It provides insights into workforce distribution by **industry, gender, and state**, with an **interactive Streamlit dashboard** and an **automated PowerPoint report**.

---

## üß† Project Objectives

- Update and analyze industrial classification data for the Indian workforce.  
- Understand **gender participation**, **state-level patterns**, and **industry-level trends**.  
- Use **NLP and clustering** to group similar industries.  
- Develop a **Streamlit dashboard** for interactive visualization.  
- Automate report generation using **PowerPoint (python-pptx)**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Steps in the Project

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection & Cleaning**
- Combined raw datasets containing **state-wise and industry-wise worker counts**.  
- Cleaned and standardized data, removed inconsistencies.  
- Extracted **State** and **District** into separate columns using text parsing.  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Engineering**
- Created calculated fields:  
  - `male_total`, `female_total`, `male_share`, `female_share`  
  - `main_to_marginal_ratio`  
- Normalized shares for comparison.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ NLP-based Industry Grouping**
- Applied **TF-IDF vectorization** to analyze industry text data.  
- Used **KMeans clustering** to identify coherent groups.  
- Added `industry_group` column for new NLP-based classification.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Visualized trends using Plotly:
  - Top industries by total workers  
  - Gender distribution  
  - State-level comparisons  
- Discovered patterns in workforce diversity and employment type.

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ PowerPoint Report Automation**
- Generated slides with **python-pptx** summarizing key findings.  
- Included interactive visuals (bar charts, sunburst plots).  
- Exported report as `Industrial_Workforce_Analysis.pptx`.

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Streamlit Dashboard**
- Built an interactive dashboard with filters for:
  - **State**, **District**, and **Industry Group**  
- Displayed KPIs, workforce composition, and sunburst charts.  
- Deployed locally and ready for Streamlit Cloud.
